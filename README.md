Title: Let's Go

Description:

Android app that tells CU Boulder students about on-campus
events, has an API to Google calendar to set reminders for user for an event
they approved, API to Google maps that wil have a limited-mile radius off the Boulder campus with different places highlighted.  User has to login with
.edu email to verify they're a student, and once they're in they can invite other friends to events.

Vision statement: Finding Campus events mad

Motivation:

The motivation behind this project is to make it easier for students to get a quick inquiry of all events taking place around campus in one single place. There are many things happening around campus that a lot of students miss simply because they weren't aware of them.


Risks:
  1. Teamates have never worked with eachother
  2. Some teammates have never worked with Java
  3. Some teamates have never worked with Android Dev
  4. Some teamates don't know how to work with databases

Mitigating Risks:

In order to mitigate these risks we will split up the tasks in such a way that each teammate will have some experience in the task they are assigned. Also, we will help eachother learn new skills that are required for the project (Android, Java, Databases etc). 

List of Requirements for the project:

Methodology: Most likely Agile

Project Tracking Software: Github, Trello

Project Plan:
