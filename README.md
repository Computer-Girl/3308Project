# 3308 Project

###Who: 

Jasmine Rethmann (Computer-Girl) Lucas Dachman (LucasDachman) Nihar Nandan (niharnandan) Jonathan Taing (taingj) Ningtian Ruan (niru32868)

###Title: 

Let's Go

###Description:

Android app that tells CU Boulder students about on-campus events, 
has an API to Google calendar to set reminders for user for an event they approved, 
API to Google maps that wil have a limited-mile radius off the Boulder campus with different places highlighted.  
User has to login with .edu email to verify they're a student, and once they're in they can invite other friends to events.

###Vision statement: 

Finding campus events made less crappier

###Motivation:

The motivation behind the project is to make it easier for students to get a quick overview of all events taking place around campus in a single place. There are many things happening around campus that a lot of students miss simply because they aren't aware of them.


###Risks:
  1. Teamates have never worked with each other.
  2. Limited knowledge of Java by some team members. 
  3. Some team members have never worked with Android Dev.
  4. Some team members don't know how to work with databases.

###Mitigating Risks:

In order to mitigate these risks, we split up the tasks in a way that each developer will have some experience in the task they are assigned to. Also, we will help each other learn new skills that are required for the project (Android, Java, Databases etc). 

###List of Requirements for the project:
* 1/U0001: As an end user, I want to be able to keep track of campus events categorically so that I can find events related to my domain. (6 hours) CRITICAL
* 2/U0002: As an end user, I want to be able to index my favourite events, so I can have a quick look at the events on the go. (8 hours)
* 3/U0003: As an end user, I want to options like resetting my password, and sharing the even via facebook or email, so I can let my friends know about the events easily. (5 hours) CRITICAL
* 4/A0001: As an event admin, I want versatility when it comes to event descriptions and locations to show precise locations, so people know that the event is exactly. (8 hours) CRITICAL
* 5/S0001: As a system admin, I should be able to grant the role of 'EVENT ADMIN' easily and to verify if the event admins are real, so as to prevent spam and creation of fake events. (8 hours)
* 6/S0002: As a system admin, I want automatic checks to the expiry of created events, so there is not a burden on the database with events not being taken off causing the app to be slow. (4 hours)

###Methodology: 

Most likely Agile

###Project Tracking Software:

For tracking our project, we use Github to improve the project and share our code with teammates, professor and TAs.

On the other hand, we use Trello to distribute different tasks to each member and check the process of our project.
