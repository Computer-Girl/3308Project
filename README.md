# 3308Project



Risks:
  1. Teamates have never worked with eachother
  2. Some teammates have never worked with Java
  3. Some teamates have never worked with Android Dev
  4. Some teamates don't know how to work with databases
Mitigating Risks:

In order to mitigate these risks we will split up the tasks in such a way that each teammate will have some experience in the task they are assigned. Also, we will help eachother learn new skills that are required for the project (Android, Java, Databases etc).
