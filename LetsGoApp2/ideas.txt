	- Each list item is clickable - give more info on events,
		link to map, link to invite friends, button to add
		event to favorites.

-Favorites page
	- Also a list activity - similar to main page but only shows favs

-Lists views can be sorted and filtered.

-login page

	-users must be authenticated (only CU students can use app?)

-Event Reminders
	-Push notifications
	-Email notifications?
	-Add favorite events to google calendar or android native calendar
