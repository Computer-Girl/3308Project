Project Plan: Basic Development i.e. what MUST be done

1. Login screen
	- give option to login
		- only accept gmail account
		- takes password
	- if not an old user, give option to create account
		- Need full name, age, major, phone number

2. Settings screen

	- If we need user to change something in settings, let's do this up 
	  front. If not ignore this step.

3. Events screen
	- What we need for the BASIC app: events on campus.  Once we
          finish the events on campus, we can see about adding events off 
          campus.

4. Events listing screen
	- Once user clicks on events on campus, list of categories should appear i.e. Athletic events, Cultural events, etc. 

5. Events listing screen cont.
	- User will pick category of events, and all events should be listed
          (sorted by event date/time preferably)

6. Logistics of Event screen
	- Info of event: 
	  When event is picked, screen displays information
	  like title of event, date, time, location.
  
	- Map: 
	  There should be an option to pull up a map to find it.  Let's see if 
	  we would be able to offer interactive directions from
	  user's current location to destination thru Google Maps.

	- Star repo:
	  This screen should also include the option to STAR an event the user
	  is interested in.  Will keep in repository for them to revisit later.

	- Calendar:
	  Option to save to Google Calendar and possibly invite others through 
	  the calendar. 

7. Star repository screen
	- User should be able to access a list of all the events starred
	  (sorted by date/time preferably).

Things to consider:

- Navigation thru app: Do we want to have a side bar to access certain screens    or back button?

- Only consider any EXTRA features (such as events off campus, friends
  component of app, etc.) after the above BASICS are done.

*** Any other thoughts/modifications/suggestions please text the group
